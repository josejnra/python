# Concurrency

**Parallelism** consists of performing multiple operations at the same time. Multiprocessing is a means to effect parallelism, and it entails spreading tasks over a computer‚Äôs central processing units (CPUs, or cores). Multiprocessing is well-suited for CPU-bound tasks: tightly bound for loops and mathematical computations usually fall into this category.

**Concurrency** is a slightly broader term than parallelism. It suggests that multiple tasks have the ability to run in an overlapping manner. (There‚Äôs a saying that concurrency does not imply parallelism.)

## Threading
Threading is a concurrent execution model whereby multiple threads take turns executing tasks. One process can contain multiple threads. Python has a complicated relationship with threading thanks to its GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) in the C implementation of python (CPython) . Python **threads** cannot take advantage of many cores. 

What‚Äôs important to know about threading is that it‚Äôs better for IO-bound tasks. While a CPU-bound task is characterized by the computer‚Äôs cores continually working hard from start to finish, an IO-bound job is dominated by a lot of waiting on input/output to complete.
To recap the above, concurrency encompasses both multiprocessing (ideal for CPU-bound tasks) and threading (suited for IO-bound tasks). Multiprocessing is a form of parallelism, with parallelism being a specific type (subset) of concurrency. The Python standard library has offered longstanding support for both of these through its *multiprocessing*, *threading*, and *concurrent.futures* packages.

## Async IO

Async functions need the ability to suspend and resume. A function that enters a waiting period is suspended, and only resumed when the wait is over. Four ways to implement suspend/resume in Python:
- Callback functions. A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to other function. This other function is expected to call this callback function in its definition. The point at which other function calls our callback function depends on the requirement and nature of other function.
- Generator functions
- Async/await (Python 3.5+)
- Greenlets (requires greenlet package)

Async functions enable you to write concurrent code using the `async/await` syntax. This powerful duo allows you to perform multiple tasks simultaneously without blocking the execution of your code. üõ†Ô∏è Think of it as having multiple browser tabs open; while one page loads, you can continue browsing other tabs. This capability means your Python applications can become faster, more efficient, and capable of handling many I/O operations.

`asyncio` library, which serves as a foundation for numerous asynchronous frameworks such as high-performance network and web servers, database connection libraries, and distributed task queues. 

The asyncio package is billed by the Python documentation as a library to write concurrent code. However, async IO is not threading, nor is it multiprocessing. It is not built on top of either of these.


Asyncio allows us to run IO-bound tasks asynchronously to increase the performance of our program. Common IO-bound tasks include calls to a database, reading and writing files to disk, and sending and receiving HTTP requests

In fact, async IO is a single-threaded, single-process design: it uses **cooperative multitasking**. It has been said in other words that async IO gives a feeling of concurrency despite using a **single thread** in a single process. Coroutines (a central feature of async IO) can be scheduled concurrently, but they are not inherently concurrent. To reiterate, async IO is a style of concurrent programming, but it is not parallelism. It‚Äôs more closely aligned with threading than with multiprocessing but is very much distinct from both of these and is a standalone member in concurrency‚Äôs bag of tricks.

### Example
Chess master Judit Polg√°r hosts a chess exhibition in which she plays multiple amateur players. She has two ways of conducting the exhibition: synchronously and asynchronously.

Assumptions:

24 opponents
Judit makes each chess move in 5 seconds
Opponents each take 55 seconds to make a move
Games average 30 pair-moves (60 moves total)

- **Synchronous version**: Judit plays one game at a time, never two at the same time, until the game is complete. Each game takes (55 + 5) * 30 == 1800 seconds, or 30 minutes. The entire exhibition takes 24 * 30 == 720 minutes, or 12 hours.
- **Asynchronous version**: Judit moves from table to table, making one move at each table. She leaves the table and lets the opponent make their next move during the wait time. One move on all 24 games takes Judit 24 * 5 == 120 seconds, or 2 minutes. The entire exhibition is now cut down to 120 * 30 == 3600 seconds, or just 1 hour.


At the heart of async IO are **coroutines**. A **coroutine** is a specialized version of a Python generator function. Let‚Äôs start with a baseline definition and then build off of it as you progress here: *a coroutine is a function that can suspend its execution before reaching return, and it can indirectly pass control to another coroutine for some time*.

### Scheduling Asynchronous Tasks
Async frameworks need a scheduler, usually called "event loop". The loop keeps track of all the running tasks. When a function is suspended, return controls to the loop, which then finds another function to start or resume. This is called **cooperative multi-tasking**.


### Async Function Without Await
It‚Äôs possible to create an async function without using the `await` keyword. However, without `await`, the async function becomes somewhat less useful, since you won‚Äôt be able to pause its execution and yield control back to the event loop. This means your async code will not be able to achieve cooperative concurrency, and other coroutines might be stuck waiting for their turn to execute. It‚Äôs generally a good idea to use `await` when working with async functions for more efficient asynchronous programming.


### When to use it
The use of async in Python is related to asynchronous programming and is particularly useful in situations where there are blocking input/output operations, such as network requests, disk read/write operations, etc. Here are some situations where you might consider using async:

#### Network Operations
- When making API calls.
- When performing HTTP requests.
- In situations where you need to wait for a response but don't want to block execution.

```python
import aiohttp

async def fetch_data():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get('https://example.com') as response:
            return await response.text()
```

#### File Input/Output
- In disk read/write operations.
- When dealing with many files simultaneously.

```python
import aiofiles

async def read_file(file_path):
    async with aiofiles.open(file_path, mode='r') as file:
        return await file.read()

```

#### Concurrent Execution
- In cases where there are multiple tasks that can be executed simultaneously.
- When using coroutines to perform concurrent operations.

```python
import asyncio

async def task1():
    # ...

async def task2():
    # ...

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(task1(), task2())

asyncio.run(main())

```

#### Asynchronous Web Applications
- In asynchronous web frameworks like FastAPI or Quart.
- In situations where you need

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

```

Using async and await allows you to write asynchronous code, improving efficiency and performance in scenarios where waiting is not necessary. However, it's important to note that the real benefit of asynchronous code is more evident in high-concurrency scenarios and in input/output-intensive operations. In simpler code, the benefit may be minimal.

### httpx vs requests vs aiohttp

#### httpx
HTTPX is a newer and more feature-rich HTTP client for Python than the popular Requests library. Here are some of the key differences between HTTPX and Requests:
- Async compatibility: HTTPX has both async and sync compatibility, which means you can use it in both asynchronous and synchronous programs. The Requests library, on the other hand, is only synchronous.
- HTTP/2 support: HTTPX supports HTTP/2, the latest HTTP protocol version. The Requests library does not have this feature.
- Automatic decoding: HTTPX includes automatic decoding of JSON and other common formats, which can save developers time and effort when working with responses that contain structured data.
- Size: HTTPX is larger than Requests, which may be a consideration for applications where size is a concern.
- Performance: HTTPX has better performance compared to Requests in most cases.

If you need to download large amounts of data, you may want to use streaming responses that don't load the entire response body into memory at once. Thankfully, HTTPX has built-in support for streaming responses.

#### aiohttp
AIOHTTP is a client for Python that is designed for use in asynchronous programs. Similarly to HTTPX, it‚Äôs built on top of the asyncio library and supports async/await syntax meaning AIOHTTP is a good choice for developers who are already familiar with asyncio and want a lightweight library for making HTTP requests. Like HTTPX, AIOHTTP supports standard HTTP methods. It also includes support for cookies, redirects, and custom headers. AIOHTTP is particularly well-suited for making HTTP requests in high-concurrency environments due to its async-first design and efficient use of resources.

#### HTTPX vs AIOHTTP
When comparing HTTPX and AIOHTTP, one of the main differences is the scope of their libraries. HTTPX is a full-featured HTTP client that can be used for a wide range of applications, while AIOHTTP is more focused on providing a simple and efficient API primarily for making HTTP requests in async programs. Another difference is that HTTPX supports synchronous and asynchronous programming, while AIOHTTP is strictly an async library. Furthermore, AIOHTTP doesn‚Äôt merely send HTTP requests but also allows the creation of HTTP servers. Usually, HTTPX can be used in a broader range of projects, while AIOHTTP may be a better choice if you are working on async-only projects and want a library optimized for async programming.

- Async compatibility: HTTPX has both async and sync compatibility, while AIOHTTP is async-only.
- HTTP/2 support: HTTPX supports HTTP/2, the latest HTTP protocol version. AIOHTTP does not have this feature.
- Performance: AIOHTTP is generally considered to have excellent performance compared to HTTPX. See the next section for a detailed analysis.
